minisphere 4.0
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fatcerberus/minisphere.svg?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/fatcerberus/minisphere)

minisphere is a drop-in replacement and successor to the Sphere game engine,
written from the ground up in C.  It boasts a high level of compatibility with
most games written for Sphere 1.x, with better performance and new functionality.
The majority of games will run with no modifications.

Like Sphere, minisphere uses JavaScript for game coding.  The engine exposes a
collection of low-level functions through a standardized JavaScript API, leaving
higher-level game logic entirely up to scripts.  This allows any type of game to
be made with minisphere; of course, this naturally requires more expertise than
making a game with, say, RPG Maker or even Game Maker, but the results are worth
it.

The engine uses Allegro 5 for graphics and sound and Duktape for JavaScript.  As
both of these are portable to various platforms, this allows minisphere to be
compiled successfully on all three major platforms (Windows, Linux, and OS X)--
and possibly others--with no changes to the source.

minisphere is not just a game engine, but a complete toolchain for game
development.  Several command-line tools, collectively known as the
minisphere GDK, are included to make game development easier:

Fully Automated Build System
----------------------------

minisphere comes with a flexible script-driven build system called Cell, which
not only allows you to package Sphere games into easy-to-distribute SPKs, but
can automatically generate assets from easier-to-modify sources.  For example:
Building tilesets from images, or minifying scripts at build time.

Cell's design borrows heavily from SCons, with a declarative approach to
scripting.  This may be confusing for those attempting to jump right in; it is
highly recommend to read the manual page for Cell before trying to write a
Cellscript for your game.

**note:** Cell is still in its infancy.  The feature set will be fleshed out in
          future versions.

Powerful Console Debugger
-------------------------

minisphere includes a powerful but easy-to-use command-line debugger, called
SSJ.  The debugger allows you to step through your game's code and inspect the
internal state of the game--variables, call stack, objects, etc.--as it
executes.  And since minisphere uses JavaScript, the original source files
aren't required to be present--SSJ can download source code directly from the
minisphere instance being debugged.

A symbolic debugger such as SSJ is an invaluable tool for development and is a
minisphere exclusive: No similar tool was ever available for Sphere 1.x.
